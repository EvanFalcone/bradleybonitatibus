# Bradley Bonitatibus

## Data Engineer & Solutions Architect

I love building robust, maintainable, and sustainable software.

I am also extremely passionate about using `CI/CD` and `SRE` principles to improve productivity as well as reliabily deliver software into production environments.

## Experience

I have experience as the lead engineer on several backend services at <a href="https://compassdigital.io">@compassdigital</a> and also maintained the Apache Airflow deployment for the organization.
The services were deployed as containers onto AWS.
I also have experience in building CI/CD pipelines for our data products and tools using both `CodePipeline` and `GitHub Actions`.
I also lead code reviews for the data science & data engineering teams, maintained several codebases, and managed our `Kanban` board.

The data pipelines I've built ingest ~40 million records per day into our data warehouse.

I am also a certified AWS Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-02).

## Hobbies

In the few spare moments of free time I have, I love taking pictures of birds.
I also love playing `bass` and listening to new and old music.
