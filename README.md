I have experience building distributed systems on `AWS` and building data pipelines that ingest on the order of ~10<sup>6</sup> events per day using `Apache Airflow`.

In the few spare moments of free time I have, I love taking pictures of birds.
I also love playing `bass` and listening to new and old music.
