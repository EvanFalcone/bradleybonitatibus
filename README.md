## Data Engineer & Solutions Architect

I love building robust, maintainable, and sustainable software.
I am currently working at <a href="https://compassdigital.io">Compass Digital Labs</a> as a Data Engineer building our core data platform and infrastructure to support our Data Science & Engineering team.

I am also extremely passionate about using `CI/CD` and `SRE` principles to improve productivity as well as reliabily deliver software into production environments.

## Experience

I'm the lead engineer on several backend services and also maintain our Apache Airflow deployment.
The backend services are written in `Go` and are deployed as containers onto AWS.
I maintain several internal codebases and implemented CI/CD in each codebase to improve
code quality, and automated deployments.

The data pipelines I've built ingest ~40 million records per day into our data warehouse.

I am also a certified AWS Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-02) and love designing
resilient, fault-tolerant, scalable systems.

## Hobbies

In the few spare moments of free time I have, I love taking pictures of birds.
