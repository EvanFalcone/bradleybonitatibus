# Bradley Bonitatibus

## Data Engineer & Solutions Architect

I love building robust, maintainable, and sustainable software.

I am also extremely passionate about using `CI/CD` and `SRE` principles to improve productivity as well as reliabily deliver software into production environments.

## Experience

I have experience building distributed systems on `AWS` and building data pipelines that ingest on the order of ~10<sup>6</sup> events per day using `Apache Airflow`.

I have experience implement `CI/CD` on `AWS` that deploys microservices as `Docker` contianers.

I am also a certified AWS Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-02).

## Hobbies

In the few spare moments of free time I have, I love taking pictures of birds.
I also love playing `bass` and listening to new and old music.
