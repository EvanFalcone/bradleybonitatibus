# Bradley Bonitatibus
Machine Learning Engineer at Loblaw Companies Limited

### Experience
Currently, I am working at Loblaw as a Machine Learning Engineer, focusing on improving our DevOps processes and building out a platform to enable 
data scientists to build production grade cloud native machine learning solutions.

I previously worked at Bond Brand Loyalty and Compass Digital Labs as a Data Engineer, in a similar capacity, bringing
DevOps to the data teams, and building streaming and batch pipelines. In addition to pipelines, I build performance
monitoring tools and backend services.

### Languages
Currently, my favourite and `go` to language is `golang`, but I am experienced in `python`, `js` (`TypeScript` + `Node` + `React`), and a tiny bit of `rust`. 

### Hobbies
I love reading books, listening to music, and taking pictures of birds and nature.
